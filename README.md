## Anomaly Detection 
#### This project is on Anomaly Detection model on Time Series data using Python.
Anomaly detection is the process of recognizing uncommon patterns, behaviors, or occurrences that significantly deviate from the anticipated norm within a given dataset or system. This technique is widely applicable across various fields to uncover infrequent or abnormal events that could indicate potential problems, possibilities, or insights. <br><br> Anomaly detection serves pivotal roles in numerous essential use cases:<br>

•	Cybersecurity: Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in pinpointing unusual patterns or activities within a network or system that may signify cyberattacks, such as intrusion attempts, malware infections, or unauthorized access.<br><br>
•	Fraud Detection: Financial institutions utilize anomaly detection to discover fraudulent transactions or activities by detecting deviations from the usual spending or transaction patterns of users.<br><br>
•	Healthcare Monitoring: Anomaly detection assists healthcare professionals in identifying atypical patient conditions or trends, enabling early detection of diseases or emergencies.<br><br>
•	Industrial Equipment Maintenance: By analyzing sensor data from machinery and equipment, anomaly detection can forecast potential breakdowns or maintenance requirements, thereby minimizing downtime and optimizing operational efficiency.<br><br>
•	Quality Control: In manufacturing processes, anomaly detection can identify faulty products by detecting deviations from the expected specifications.
•	Network Monitoring: IT teams employ anomaly detection to identify network performance issues, bandwidth spikes, or unusual traffic patterns that could indicate network failures or attacks.<br><br>
•	Environmental Monitoring: Anomaly detection can be applied to environmental data, such as measurements of air quality or water quality, to detect uncommon pollution levels or ecological changes.<br><br>

In the realm of data analysis, outliers hold a distinctive position, serving as critical indicators of unusual occurrences and insights within datasets. Detecting outliers involves a multi-faceted approach that combines statistical methods, domain expertise, and advanced modeling techniques. <br><br>Here are key points to consider:<br>
•	Global Outliers: These are data points that significantly deviate from the overall dataset's statistical norms, often indicating exceptional events or measurement errors.<br><br>
•	Contextual Outliers: Consider attributes or context-specific factors when identifying anomalies, enabling a more nuanced understanding of irregularities within specific subsets of data.<br><br>
•	Time Series Data: Analyzing outliers in time series involves detecting sudden spikes, drops, or persistent deviations from expected temporal patterns, aiding in trend identification and anomaly detection.<br><br>
